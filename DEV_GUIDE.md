# Stellarity Enlightened Dev Guide

## Basic Project Tooling Info

This project uses deobfuscated Mojmap, and may be inconsistent with old Fabric tutorials using yarn. Should you ever
need to apply an old fabric tutorial to implement something,
use [Linkie](https://linkie.shedaniel.dev/mappings?namespace=yarn&translateMode=ns&translateAs=mojang_raw&search=) for
Mojmap and Yarn conversions (or general lookups).

## General Project Structure

Use `dev.coder2195.stellarity.snake_case_for_packages.PascalCaseForClasses`

If you know a class will only contain `static final` fields and `static` methods, we use an `interface` to implement the
class.

If you know that a class will mostly be an initialize one, never write class, we will implement it as a `record`.

Idgaf if you use explicit types or implicit `var` for method variables cuz at the end of the day we all have IDEs.
However, personal choice wise as the lead dev, do recommend `var` because multiversion
works better with vars (if we get versions worth multiversioning). We all have IDEs with inlay hints so yea.

## Registries

Registries are in the format `Stellarity[TypeName]s` such as `StellarityBlocks` for **Block** registry in the `registry`
package.

For custom Stellarity definitions for registries, use `block.CustomBlock` for example. Note the package is singular.

## Events

Events are like registries, but instead we hook up usually to event listeners through APIs. You can tell very easily if
something is an event where you will have `Something.EVENT` and you hook it up to a lambda or method reference.

**IMPORTANT: Registries supercede events. If there is something you are registering and need some form of event to add
with it, put it in Registries**

They go in `events` package and can be more named for their purpose like `StellarityTooltips` for tooltip related stuff.

If in doubt, drop them into Registries, and someone will move them later.

## Resource Keys

We track resource keys for data driven definitions in `key` package. Name formatting is mostly the same, except they
should be in this format instead

```java
public interface StellarityExampleTypes {
	ResourceKey<Type> AN_EXAMPLE = id("an_example");

	static ResourceKey<Type> id(String id) {
		return Stellarity.key(Registries.TYPE, id);
	}
}
```

## Tag Keys

This is the exact same as Resource Keys except it is now `TagKey.create(Registries.TYPE, Stellarity.id(id))`

## Mixins

All mixins are defined in the format `mixin.purpose_or_targetted_noun.[VanillaClassName]Mixin`

This is to keep code clean and easy to find relevant mixins corresponding to a purpose. DO NOT add these to
`fabric.mod.json` despite the warning. Stonecutter's Fletching Table tool handles registration.

In the event you get an `Not transformed` exception, run the clean task. Then check to see if your code has gone wrong
if it persists.

## Interface Injections

These are used for extending vanilla classes with extra definitions. They must be in `Ext[VanillaClass]` and
`Ext[VanillaClass][InnerClass]` if inner classes are ambigious.

Methods MUST be `default`, `throw AssertionError("Not transformed!")`, and be prefixed with `stellarity$`

They should then be implemented in mixins in `mixin.interface_injections`. Injection mixins should NOT contain anything
else and must be defined there and there only.

## Gui Elements/Screens

All gui elements and screen must be in `dev.coder2195.stellarity.client.gui`.

Those will then be placed accordingly to categories, widgets go in `widget`, screens go in `screen`, and so on.
Ask if you are unsure.

## Client

**IMPORTANT: Always put client files in src/client, and make sure it is in the `dev.coder2195.stellarity.client`
package. DO NOT put client code in the main source set. (It shouldn't even let you)**

**This prevents server side crashes and all client code MUST be annotated and be inside this package**

All client generally follow the same conventions mentioned above, but the "root" now is
`dev.coder2195.stellarity.client`

Are you unsure about if it should be client or not? Check the related vanilla class you are trying to build for, and if
those are annotated, move them to client.

## Datagen

All providers go in the **src/client** source set just like client, except its in `dev.coder2195.stellarity.datagen`.

All providers should be in the root of the package, and should be named `[Type]Provider` such as `ModelProvider` for
models.

The following exceptions apply:

- If you are generating tags, they must go in `datagen.tags`
- If you are generating modnomicon book related assets, they must go in `datagen.book`
- If you are generating loot table related assets, they must go in `datagen.loot_table`
- If you are generating any other data-driven registry, they can go inside `datagen.dynamic` and should have relevant
  methods added to `DynamicRegistryProvider.buildRegistry` and `DynamicRegistryProvider.configure`

## Util

Utilities can go in `util`.

## Data Handling

### Is the thing I'm targetting an entity we own?

**Does the client need the data?**

Do NOT create a private field, and use `EntityDataAccessor`s and `defineSynchedData`. Create getters and setters to
interact with `SynchedEntityData entityData` present on all entities.

**The client does not need the data?**

Create a private field and use normal getters and setters.

**Does the data need to be saved across world loads?**

Use `addAdditionalSaveData` and `readAdditionalSaveData` to save and load the data. **Use Codecs to load and save the
data. DO NOT USE putInt, putFloat, putBool, putJSON, etc**

### Does the thing I'm targetting include the server, a level, chunk access, not our (block) entity?

Use data attachments, in `registries/StellarityDataAttachments.java` and beware of the following:

**Does the data need to be saved across world loads?**

Use `persistent` for anything that should be saved and loaded

**Does the client need the data?**

- Make data attachments `syncWith` if they need to be synchronized to the client. Use with discretion, as unnessecary
  networking should be avoided.

### No data attachments available and needs modification?

Use interface injections, mixins, and optionally the Codec extension helper we have. Ask the lead dev for more details

## Adding Translations

Make sure the translation submodule is added to your project. If it is not, add it by running
`git submodule update --init --recursive` in the root of the project.

Translations should be added via the translation python script. This helps manage automatic synchronization between the
resources folder and the git submodule.
